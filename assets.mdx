This page documents how **assets** are organized and managed in the **R-Type project**. Assets include graphical sprites, sound effects, animations, and fonts, which are essential for building an engaging game experience.

## Asset Organization

<Accordion title="Folder Structure">
All assets are stored in the root `assets/` folder, and they are divided into subdirectories to separate different types of assets:

### Folder Structure:
```plaintext
assets/
├── sprites/        # Sprite images (PNG)
├── sounds/         # Sound effects (WAV)
├── fonts/          # Font files (TTF)
├── shaders/        # Shader files (VERT)
├── animations/     # Animation configuration files
└── others/         # Miscellaneous assets
```
### Explanation:
- **`sprites/`**: Contains all images used as game sprites.
- **`sounds/`**: Includes sound effects such as explosions, background music, and UI sounds.
- **`fonts/`**: Stores font files required for rendering text.
- **`shaders/`**: Contains vertex and fragment shader files for advanced rendering effects.
- **`animations/`**: Configuration files that define animation frames, sprite sheets, and timings.
- **`others/`**: Any other assets not covered by the above categories.

## Asset Loading and Management

<Accordion title="How Assets Are Loaded">
Assets are loaded at runtime by the graphical module through the `IDisplayModule` interface:

1. **Sprites (PNG):**
   - Loaded using the `storeAssetsPNG` function, which reads the sprite file and prepares it for rendering.
   ```cpp
   displayModule->storeAssetsPNG("assets/sprites/player.png");
   ```

2. **Sound Effects (WAV):**
   - Managed with the `storeAssetsWAV` function to load and play sounds.
   ```cpp
   displayModule->storeAssetsWAV("assets/sounds/explosion.wav");
   ```

3. **Fonts (TTF):**
   - Loaded using the `storeAssetsTTF` function for text rendering.
   ```cpp
   displayModule->storeAssetsTTF("assets/fonts/arial.ttf");
   ```

4. **Animations:**
   - Configured with `configAssetsAnimations` to map sprite sheets and frame data.
   ```cpp
   displayModule->configAssetsAnimations("assets/animations/player_animation.cfg");
   ```
</Accordion>

## Best Practices for Asset Management

1. **Organize Assets**: Keep assets logically structured within subfolders to improve maintainability.
2. **Optimize File Sizes**: Use compressed images (PNG) and sound files (WAV) to reduce loading times.
3. **Avoid Redundancy**: Remove unused assets to minimize project size.
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use a clear and consistent naming convention for assets, such as:
   ```plaintext
   player_idle.png
   player_run.png
   explosion.wav
   arial.ttf
   ```
5. **Centralize Configuration**: Store animation configurations in dedicated files to simplify updates.

## Conclusion

The **`assets/`** folder is the centralized location for managing all game-related assets. With clear organization and runtime loading through the `IDisplayModule` interface, the R-Type project ensures an efficient and scalable approach to asset management.
