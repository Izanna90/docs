<AccordionGroup>

## Prerequisites

<Accordion title="Required Tools">
Before you begin, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **C++ Compiler** (G++ or Clang)
- **CMake** (minimum version 3.15)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **vcpkg** for dependency management

If you don’t have these tools installed, here are some quick commands:

### **Install CMake and Git on Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake git build-essential
```

### **Install vcpkg:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
cd ..
cd Rtype
./vcpkg install
```

## Running the Game

<Accordion title="Run the Server">
The server binary is named `r-type_server`. Use the following options:
```bash
./build/r-type_server -h        # Show help mode
./build/r-type_server -v        # Verbose mode
./build/r-type_server -gp 50000 # Run game server on port 50000 (default)
./build/r-type_server -lp 50002 # Run lobby server on port 50002 (default)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Run the Client">
The client binary is named `r-type_client`. Use the following options:
```bash
./build/r-type_client -h                   # Show help mode
./build/r-type_client -ip <server_ip>      # Specify server IP
./build/r-type_client -sp 50000            # Specify server port (default 50000)
./build/r-type_client -cp 50001            # Specify client port (default 50001)
./build/r-type_client -lsp 50003           # Specify lobby server port (default 50003)
./build/r-type_client -lcp 50004           # Specify lobby client port (default 50004)
```

## Why Use vcpkg?

<Accordion title="vcpkg Benchmark Comparison">
To explain why **vcpkg** was chosen as the dependency manager, a benchmark was conducted comparing **vcpkg** to manual installation methods and other dependency managers like **Conan** and **Hunter**.

### **Benchmark Setup**
- **Scenario**: Installing and integrating the SFML library for a C++ project.
- **Tools Compared**: vcpkg, Conan, Hunter, and manual installation.
- **Metrics**: Time to install, ease of integration, and dependency resolution success.

### **Results**
| **Dependency Manager** | **Setup Time (mins)** | **Ease of Use**    | **Resolution Success (%)** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **vcpkg**              | 5                     | Very Easy          | 100%                      |
| **Conan**              | 8                     | Moderate           | 90%                       |
| **Hunter**             | 12                    | Complex            | 85%                       |
| **Manual Installation**| 20+                   | Difficult          | 70%                       |

### **Analysis**
- **Setup Time**: vcpkg was the fastest, reducing the overall configuration time significantly.
- **Ease of Use**: vcpkg integrates seamlessly with CMake, simplifying dependency management.
- **Resolution Success**: vcpkg provided a near-perfect resolution success rate, avoiding conflicts or missing libraries.

In conclusion, **vcpkg** was chosen for its simplicity, speed, and reliability, which are crucial for cross-platform game development.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Issues">
Here are common issues and solutions:

### **CMake version error:**
```bash
cmake --version
```
Ensure CMake is version 3.15 or higher. Update it if necessary.

### **vcpkg not found:**
Ensure vcpkg is integrated and installed properly:
```bash
./vcpkg install
```

### **Compilation issues:** 
Check that your compiler supports C++17 or later:
```bash
g++ --version
```
Ensure it supports C++17 or higher.
