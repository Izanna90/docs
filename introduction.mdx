R-Type is a classic shoot 'em up game reimagined as a multiplayer networked experience. This project focuses on creating a robust **client-server architecture** that enables real-time gameplay between multiple players. The goal is to implement the core mechanics of R-Type while ensuring scalability, performance, and smooth communication over a network.
