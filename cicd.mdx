title: CI/CD Pipeline Documentation
description: Explanation of the CI/CD pipeline setup, including compilation, testing, mirroring, linting, and project ruleset.
---

This page describes the **CI/CD pipeline** implemented in the R-Type project. The pipeline ensures smooth development, automatic testing, and clean code standards through a series of actions.

## CI/CD Actions

<Accordion title="1. Compilation on Windows (MSVC)">
The CI pipeline includes an **action for compilation on Windows** using **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++). 

### Key Steps:
1. Install dependencies with vcpkg.
2. Build the project using CMake and MSVC.

**Example Workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up vcpkg
        run: |
          git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
          cd vcpkg && bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
      - name: Compile Project
        run: |
          cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
          cmake --build build --config Release
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Compilation and Testing on Ubuntu (GTest)">
On Ubuntu, the pipeline compiles the project and runs **unit tests** written with **Google Test**.

### Key Steps:
1. Install dependencies using vcpkg.
2. Build the project with GCC/Clang.
3. Run unit tests using GTest.

**Example Workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build-ubuntu:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt update && sudo apt install cmake g++-11
          git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
          cd vcpkg && ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
      - name: Compile and Run Tests
        run: |
          cmake -S . -B build
          cmake --build build
          cd build && ctest
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Mirroring to Epitech Repository">
To comply with Epitech requirements, an **action mirrors** the repository to the Epitech GitLab server.

### Key Steps:
1. Push updates to the remote Epitech repository.

**Example Workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  mirror-to-epitech:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Push to Epitech Repository
        run: |
          git remote add epitech https://git.epitech.eu/username/rtype.git
          git push epitech main --force
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Code Linting and Formatting">
The pipeline ensures **code consistency** using **cpplint** and **Clang-Format** (Google style guide). If formatting errors are detected, a commit with corrected code is pushed automatically.

### Linter Configuration:
- **cpplint**: Checks for style and structure issues.
- **Clang-Format**: Applies automatic formatting.

**Example Workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run cpplint
        run: |
          pip install cpplint
          cpplint --recursive .
      - name: Apply Clang-Format
        run: |
          clang-format -i $(find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.hpp")
          git config user.name "CI Bot"
          git config user.email "ci@bot.com"
          git commit -am "CI: Applied clang-format corrections" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push
```
</Accordion>

## Branch Ruleset

To ensure code quality and prevent unapproved changes, the following ruleset is enforced:

1. **No Direct Pushes to Main**: All changes must be submitted through a **Pull Request (PR)**.
2. **Approval Requirements**: 
   - A minimum of **two approvals** is required to merge a Pull Request.
3. **CI/CD Validation**:
   - All CI/CD actions (compilation, testing, linting) must pass successfully before merging.
4. **Automatic Checks**: Code linting and formatting ensure that all committed code adheres to the **Google C++ Style Guide**.

---

## Conclusion

The **CI/CD pipeline** automates the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring code quality, consistency, and compliance with project standards. With actions for **compilation**, **testing**, **mirroring**, and **linting**, the pipeline minimizes manual intervention and streamlines the development workflow.
