## Adding a New Graphical Library

<Accordion title="Steps to Add a New Graphical Library">
To add a new graphical library, you need to implement the **IDisplayModule** interface and integrate it into the project.

### Steps:
1. **Implement the IDisplayModule**: 
   - Create `.hpp` and `.cpp` files for the new library in the `graphic/` folder located inside the `engine/` directory.
   - Implement all the virtual functions defined in `IDisplayModule`.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   #include "IDisplayModule.hpp"

   class NewLibraryModule : public zef::graph::IDisplayModule {
   public:
       void initialize(std::string assetFolderPath, std::string windowName) override {
           // Code to initialize the window and load assets
       }
       void refresh() override {
           // Code to refresh the screen
       }
       // Implement other required methods...
   };
   ```

2. **Integrate the Library with CMake**:
   - Add the new `.hpp` and `.cpp` files to the `CMakeLists.txt` located in the `engine/graphic` folder:
     ```cmake
     set(GRAPHICAL_LIB_SRCS
         ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/NewLibraryModule.cpp
     )
     ```

3. **Test the New Library**:
   - Compile the project and ensure the library works as expected.
   - Test graphical rendering, input handling, and performance.

## Adding New Server Commands

<Accordion title="Steps to Add New TCP Commands">
To add new **TCP commands** for the server:

### Steps:
1. **Define the Command**:
   - Add the new command and its logic in the server's command handler.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   if (command == "NEW_CMD") {
       // Handle the new TCP command
       send_response(client, "200: Command executed successfully");
   }
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Add the new command to the TCP protocol documentation.

3. **Test the Command**:
   - Verify the command works with the client-server communication flow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Steps to Add New UDP Commands">
To add new **UDP commands** for real-time communication:

### Steps:
1. **Define the Packet Header and Logic**:
   - Update the UDP packet structure to handle the new command.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   struct Header {
       uint8_t cmd;
       uint16_t payload_size;
       uint32_t sequence_id;
   };

   if (header.cmd == NEW_CMD) {
       // Process UDP packet content
   }
   ```

2. **Add the Command in the Command Handler**:
   - Update the server's UDP processing loop to include the new command.

3. **Test the Command**:
   - Ensure the new command is sent and processed correctly in real time.
